Spatial Visualizations and Analysis in Python with Folium (with multiple case studies)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Geospatial Analysis is a technique of building and analyzing map-based visualizations made from GPS data, sensors, mobile devices, satellite imagery, and other sources. Visuals can be maps, cartograms, graphs, etc. The recognizable maps make it easy to understand and act upon. Location-based events are easily understandable using geospatial analysis. Location aspects often dictate various trends. For example, a residential area in a city having more expensive properties will likely have people with higher incomes, and they will spend higher amounts of money.

We can see that after 10:00 PM the traffic starts to reduce in New York City but the city again becomes crowded at 8:00 AM. Also, the buses run 24/7. Manhattan is the most crowded borough of New York followed by Brooklyn. Staten Island is the borough with the least traffic in New York.
